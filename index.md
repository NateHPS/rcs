> "What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.”
― Kurt Vonnegut, Palm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collage

## Welcome to RCS
River City Social is a monthly newsletter that shares in-person art and community events in the Shreveport/Bossier area. A list of local events will be sent directly to your email. Please use the links below to sign up for the newsletter and to submit events for the upcoming month. We are figuring out some technical details as we go so please bear with us as we improve. Design, timing, proofreading, etc, will take some time to get right. We hope this service will help people stay informed about local events without relying on increasingly dysfunctional (anti)social media platforms.
